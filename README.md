# Chromium-after-rapid-release-cycles
The effects of a switch to Rapid Release Cycles - a study on the Chromium Browser in comparison with existing studies on Mozilla Firefox

Identifies the effects of switching from a conventional release cycle to a rapid release cycle on software quality.

I acquired bugs raised in bug repositories, for the periods before and after the documented (yet tentative) transition to rapid cycle releases.
I parsed these bug reports to identify:

  1. Frequency of issues reported over time
  2. Average duration to fix issues
  
And compared these metrics to find patterns in both projects - Mozilla Firefox and Chromium.
